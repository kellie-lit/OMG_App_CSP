    <h1>O.M.G.</h1>
    <h3>
        Empowering ourselves, as indivuals to use our own sensual energy, confidence, and movement to create One More Gain in the life that we desire!
    </h3>

    <div class="textSnippet"> 
        <h4>
            Society has forced us into a state of rest inertia. One More Gain is here to break through those societal norms and help us embrace our embodied spirituality. When we fall out of our minds and stumble back into our sensual, confident, and lively selves. We are not just visceral beings reacting to external forces. The body is a Divine temple. It is meant to be a living expression of art and movement which is deeply rooted within us all!

          Who is Kellie? I am a Movement/Embodiment Coach. I teach practices and tools to help people deepen their confidence, and self-awareness and open up a new world through movement, fun, and fitness into the most mundane moments of everyday life. 
          A little about my background. Growing up I cheered from middle school to high school while running track for 14 years. Which is how I obtained a track and academic scholarship to ITU. Unfortunately,  I did not have any passions outside of track and school. As soon as I graduated with my degree in Psychology. I did not know who Kellie actually was. I went on to do a philanthropist, people devolvement specialist a special needs nanny, and finally a personal trainer/cross-fit coach but still felt like something was missing. 
          
          In my spare time, I decided to put myself out there and get into things I could have never imagined. I become a freelance model, model coach, photographer, and last but not least a basic salsa/bachata instructor. I am a very shy and introverted individual and I knew I needed to get out of my comfort zone and try new things outside of only fitness. 
          
          Just by throwing myself out there with good intentions, I had the opportunity to model for brand names Boy Meets Girl, Detroit Denim, and Goodboy, Inc. I was able to walk in runway shows in Detroit, Atlanta, and Miami. I have coached models for fashion shows and photoshoots. All while learning contemporary dance, salsa, and bachata. This is an overload, right? Well, thank the Divine for mediation and my best friend, which is a Physical Therapist Assistant. As a certified personal trainer with a psychology degree, I know how to coach on a psychological and physical level. Due to my love of holistic wellness, I can provide you with the skills, confidence, and knowledge that you'll need to have that moment in your life to say O.M.G. I am happy to be me and radiate even more in everyday life.
